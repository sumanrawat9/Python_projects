**Project 1: ** **Color Classification Using Average RGB Values**
This Python project leverages OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas to classify the predominant color in an image by calculating its average RGB values and matching it to a predefined set of color names. This project is useful for applications where identifying the predominant color in an image is required, such as in image analysis, digital art, and design tools.
